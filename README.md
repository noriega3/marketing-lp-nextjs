# company-landing-page

## About
This is an unbranded version of a marketing landing page rewritten to use Next.js from a custom WPBakery WordPress theme.

Originally, only the form was written in React and embedded in WordPress by creating a custom plugin (link TBD).  For the next marketing iteration, I wanted to focus on speed and further optimize the [Google Page Rank](https://www.semrush.com/blog/pagerank/) scores which are vital for successful marketing campaigns.
